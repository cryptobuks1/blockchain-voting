# Hyperledger Voting System

## Setup Environment

Insert setup instructions here. Make a script?

## Execution

We made it simple by creating some easy to use bash scripts. 

1) Run `start.sh` from the setup-scripts folder.
2) Run `npm start` in the voting-angular-app.
3) To populate the network with our pre-defined data, run `addAssets.sh` and `addParticipants.sh`. *(Optional)*
4) To run Composer playground, run `composer-playground`. *(Optional)*

And that is it! Now if you go to `localhost:4200`, you should be able to view the front-end webpage. If you want to view the Composer playground, go to `localhost:8080`.
